        <p id="sourcesintro">Below you'll find information about some sources of coffee beans</p>
        
        <h2>ðŸ‡ªðŸ‡¹ Ethiopia</h2>
        <p id="ethiopia">Ethiopia is the largest coffee producing country in Africa and also the largest consumer of Ethiopian coffee beans, 
        with half of the coffee that is produced being consumed within the country. Here is where the Arabica coffee bean originates from, 
        making Ethiopia an epicenter for coffee tourism and where the history of coffee consumption begins. Many high quality beans are 
        grown here with diverse tones and aromas.</p>
        
        <h2>ðŸ‡§ðŸ‡· Brazil</h2>
        <p id="brazil">Far and away the largest exporter and producer of coffee beans, Brazil is the biggest supplier of coffee for the U.S., 
        Germany, Japan, Italy, and many others. Brazil primarily grows the Arabica and Robusta types of coffee bean. Arabica beans tend to have 
        a higher acidity, with fruity tones, while Robusta has a stronger more harsher taste, and tends to make up a larger portion of lower quality 
        coffee typically found in supermarkets.</p>
        
        <h2>ðŸ‡»ðŸ‡³ Vietnam</h2>
        <p id="vietnam">Vietnamese coffee agriculture makes up the next largest portion of the coffee trade, following Brazil. The main variety of 
        coffee bean that is grown in Vietnam is the Robusta bean which makes up many blends and is noted for having a harsher taste and a high caffeine 
        content.</p>
